================
In this excercise you are required to create a "Release" Job for an "on-prem" application.
The first part will create a manually triggerd job, and after that it will be git triggered.

Instructions:
-------------
1. Create a manually triggered jenkins pipeline that accepts version parameter (e.g. '1.2').
   Script logic:
   a. If branch `release/{x.y}` does not exist:
      - Creates the branch from `master`.
      - Updates `version.txt` to reflect the branch `x.y`, but still includes "NOT FOR RELEASE".
      - Commits & pushes the branch, with new `version.txt`.
   b. Pull sources and checkout `release/{x.y}`.
   c. Calculate and set a set a 3-number version (`x.y.z`) in `version.txt`.
   d. Build
   e. Test
   f. Release (push to ECR) - using the full release version as the tag.
   g. `git clean` & `git tag` & `git push tag`.

2. Update script to be triggered by push.
   Script logic:
   a. When triggered manually - as before.
   b. When triggered by push:
      - If on a banch called `release/{x.y}` it will perform release for `x.y`.
      - If on any other branch - it will just perform build.
